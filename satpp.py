# 1) If any clause consists of a single variable, set the variable so
# that this clause is satisfied
#
# 2) If a variable appears just once (and it hasn't been set, see
# below), set it so that the respective clause is satisfied
#
# 3) Remove all clauses that have become satisfied
#
# 4) Remove all variables that evaluate to 'FALSE' (i.e., all variables x
# that are set to FALSE and all variables not(x) where x is set to TRUE).
# If this results in an empty clause, then the input formula has no satisfying
# assignment and the function should return the Boolean formula [[1],[-1]]
#
# The challenging part is implementing Rule 2, for your function must
# perform the data reductions exhaustively, that is, until they can no
# further be applied: After rules 2, 3 and 4 have been applied, there
# might be other clauses for which rule 2 now becomes applicable (you
# will have to be careful if a variable that now appears once has
# already been set earlier - if not, then Rule 2 may apply, otherwise
# it doesn't).
#
# If through the pre-processing steps you are able to determine that a
# SAT problem is satisfiable then return []. Likewise, if you
# determine that it is unsatisfiable then return [[1],[-1]]. Otherwise,
# return the remaining clauses.
